#  Forecasting Demand for Critical Health Commodities

## üìò Overview

This project focuses on **developing a machine learning-based demand forecasting model** for essential health commodities across different health categories such as **HIV/AIDS, maternal and child health, tuberculosis, and COVID-19**.  
By leveraging historical order data, fiscal year funding, and program details, the project aims to **enhance inventory management**, **reduce stockouts**, and **improve procurement strategies** for critical health supplies.

## üéØ Research Problem

Health systems often face challenges in maintaining an optimal stock of medical commodities due to uncertain demand patterns, funding delays, and logistical bottlenecks.  
The goal of this project is to build a **data-driven forecasting model** that can accurately predict future demand for each product category, enabling more reliable supply chain planning.

## üåç Data Source

The dataset used for this project is publicly available through the **USAID GHSC-PSM Health Commodity Delivery Dataset**:

üîó [Dataset Link](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/usaid-ghsc-psm-health-commodity-delivery-dataset)

It contains detailed information on global health product deliveries, program categories, funding sources, and geographic coverage.

## üìä Input Features

The model utilizes multiple feature categories that influence demand:

### 1. Historical Demand Data
- Order Volume (past quantities)
- Order Frequency
- Stockout Events

### 2. Temporal Features
- Fiscal Year and Quarter
- Seasonality Trends

### 3. Health Program Details
- Health Category (HIV/AIDS, MCH, COVID-19, etc.)
- Product Category (ARV drugs, vaccines, PPE, etc.)
- Funding Source (USAID, Global Fund)
- Program Scale (population or geographic reach)

### 4. Geographic and Demographic Features
- Country or Region
- Population Metrics
- Disease Prevalence
- Health Indicators (e.g., vaccination rates)

### 5. Economic and Logistical Features
- Funding Levels
- Supplier Lead Times
- Delivery Reliability

### 6. External Factors
- Pandemic/Epidemic Events (e.g., COVID-19)
- Policy or Regulatory Changes
- Global Supply Chain Constraints

## üéØ Output Targets

The model can support multiple prediction objectives:

- **Time Series Forecasting:** Predict future demand quantities for a specific time horizon.  
- **Classification (Optional):** Categorize future demand into *Low*, *Moderate*, or *High*.  
- **Inventory Optimization:** Recommend reorder quantities to minimize shortages and overstocking.

## üß† Machine Learning Pipeline

### **Step 1: Data Preprocessing**
- Handle missing values (orders, funding, etc.)
- Aggregate data by month or quarter
- Encode categorical variables
- Normalize continuous variables

### **Step 2: Feature Engineering**
- Identify trends and seasonality
- Create lag and rolling-window features
- Generate interactions (e.g., Health Category √ó Region)

### **Step 3: Model Selection**
- **Time Series Models:** ARIMA, SARIMA, Prophet  
- **Machine Learning Models:** Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM  
- **Deep Learning Models:** LSTM or Transformer-based architectures

### **Step 4: Model Evaluation**
- Metrics: `MAPE`, `MAE`, `RMSE`
- Use backtesting to compare predicted vs. actual demand

### **Step 5: Model Deployment**
- Integrate model with dashboards for visualization
- Use predictions for dynamic inventory management
